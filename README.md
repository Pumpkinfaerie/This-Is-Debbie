<h1>Debbie is the greatest!</h1>

<p>Welcome to Debbie's first website, where you can find answers to all those burning questions you have about one of the most awesome people in the world- Debbie!</p>

<p>I will be adding pictures, tables, interesting and general information so I can practice my html skills to the max.</p>

<p>It's only fair that I also give a shout out one of the most super duper people I know- Jaimo! He's clever, sweet and funny, and the best boyfriend anyone has ever had in the history of the world.</p>
